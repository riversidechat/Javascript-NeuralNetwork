# Javascript-NeuralNetwork

I've been watching The Coding Train's video on Neural Networks (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aCibgK1PTWWu9by6XFdCfh).
Thought I would test out my new-found skills for a basic neural network.

To test, just open the project in the browser, use the left click to train the perceptron.
The pink and orange circles are the ones the perceptron got wrong, likewise, the blue and green ones are the correctly guessed ones.
